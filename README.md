#Project 1 pt-a: Aloha Apparel Site
Project 1 pt-a at RED was our first forray into the world of HTML5 and CSS3. This project was about building the foundation level to further expand upon for [pt-b of Project 1.](https://teeppope.github.io/Aloha-Apparel-v2/) 

##About the Aloha Site
The Aloha Apparel Site is a mock e-commerce single page site using HTML5 and CSS3 to build out the base layout and styles of the webpage.

###Technology Used
Below are the languages used to code this single-page site:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Git for Version Control

##Meaningful Takeaways
My First mistake: Not git init-ing my project website the sameday we learned git. I feel had I done this, it would have given me the opportunity to get more practice using git and the CLI, but also would have allowed me the opportunity to roll back (the rim to win) to previous better working situations within my code. This would have been really nice for such situations as when I was styling my subscription form a couple different times experimenting how/what worked best, and learning which attribute/value pairs did what.

My Second mistake: Coding for mobile first. JUST KIDDING, that could never be a mistake. Sure it took longer than just doing the basic homepage, but it was actually a great learning opportunity, one of which challenged my brain into structuring the page into a logical style structures to work across all screen sizes, then adding just the specific larger screen sized styles when needed.

Overall, the making of this project was enjoyable, challenging and really pushed my procrastination habbits to the limit. I shocked myself with the level of focus I put into creating this and I'm looking forward to feedback for ways to improve!
